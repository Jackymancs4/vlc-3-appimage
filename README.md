A repository for building a VLC 3.0.x AppImage on [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/).

## Why?
Because most distros are yet to upgrade their repositories to the latest VLC version.

## Credits
This repo is mainly based on the work of [Anupam Basak](https://github.com/anupam-git/vlc-appimage) and [darealshinji](https://github.com/darealshinji/vlc-AppImage).

## Download
Download the AppImage from [here](https://github.com/icflorescu/vlc-3-appimage/releases/).

## How do I know it's safe?
As with most things you download from the Internet nowadays, you can't. But you can inspect the source code, improve it, decide for yourself whether to download the AppImage from the link above or create your own fork.
